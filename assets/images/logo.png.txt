This is a placeholder for the logo.png file.

To create a proper logo, you can:
1. Design a logo using tools like Figma, Canva, or Adobe Illustrator
2. Use an AI logo generator
3. Create a simple text-based logo using CSS

Recommended specifications:
- Size: 40x40 pixels (minimum), scalable
- Format: PNG with transparency
- Style: Modern, clean, represents depth/wisdom
- Colors: Should work with both light and dark themes

For now, the application will work without the logo image.
The header will show just the text "Sodeep" if the image is missing.
